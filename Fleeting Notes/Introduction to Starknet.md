# Introduction to Starknet
- There is no distinction between EOA and contract addresses in Starknet
	- EOA's are represented as contracts that define account logic
		- ex. Signatures required to control who can issue transactions on it
- `STARKNET_WALLET` env variable indicates to use `__default__`  account generated by `starknet deploy_account`
	- specify `--no_wallet` to override
