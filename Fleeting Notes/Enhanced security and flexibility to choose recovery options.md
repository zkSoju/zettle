# Enhanced security and flexibility to choose recovery options

- Key management and true "self-custody" introduces the idea of the encryption paradox 
	- Encryption simultaneously makes us both more secure and less secure
- Giving your private key to a centralized recovery service gives them the ability to steal funds?
	- Could be an added waiting period for a user to deny illegitimate key requests
	- Can choose friends and family as recovery
- **Programmable money requires programmable access**
	- Every user deserves flexibility in choosing their path to self-sovereignty 
- Proposed stages of self-sovereignty 
	- Beginner - Web2 style authentication, centralized key management
	- Intermediate - Social recovery
	- Advanced - Management of own private key
- Ultimately allows for additional recovery flows or 2FA that is not available with traditional EOA without relying on a centralized third party service
	- Leads to [Incremental decentralization](https://medium.com/abridged-io/incremental-decentralization-7f0110b0997)
