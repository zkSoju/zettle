# Code first approach with Nexus and TypeGraphQL
- Stronger types?
- Added validation because Prisma client is used inside of resolvers versus just returning resolver map?
- Most SDL-first problems stem from mapping manually written SDL schemas to resolvers
- What is Code first?
	- Schema generated from code that implements schema
	- Allows developers to use programming language their using instead of being tied to tooling available for that language
- `graphene` for python `absinthe-graphql` for elixir
- Schema definitions that are generated are still checked into version control
- [[Misconceptions behind SDL-first and Code-first]]
