# An example of pure revenue
- In 2018 a user bought and sold FreeToken on exchange A to a user on exchange B for a 1000% profit, which is seemingly a result of a typo "off-by-one" error
	- Was executed in a smart contract as an atomic batch
- Although other opps can be generated from inconsistent price feeds or variance across exchange designs 
- To calculate profits we subtract costs from revenue
	- Costs: 113265 gas * 134 gwei = 0.015 ETH
	- Revenue: .79 ETH
	- Profits: .79 - .015 = .77 ETH
