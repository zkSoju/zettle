# Computational Integrity

- Computational integrity can come from a variety of sources:
	- Reputation and delegated accountability (ex. banks)
		- Lawyers and society delegated accountants
	- Naive replay (ex. Ethereum L1 and Bitcoin)
		- Publicity and visibility for anyone to recompute data and prove it's validity
	- Trusted execution enviornments (ex. EVM and SGX)
		- Assumption that physical computer cannot be tampered with, which is encrypted and can sign over its correct executions
	- Fraud proofs (ex. Optimism)
		- Combination of naive replay, delegated accountability, and game theoretic incentives
	- Cryptographic proofs (ex. zkSTARK on Starknet)
