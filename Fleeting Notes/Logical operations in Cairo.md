# Logical operations in Cairo

- Cairo does not have a `<` operator because in the Cairo machine this is a complicated operation
- Cairo has a builtin called range-check for comparing values and library functions to invoke it
- We can use this simple math trick to verify value is in a range
	- `x * (x - 1) * (x - 2) = 0`
