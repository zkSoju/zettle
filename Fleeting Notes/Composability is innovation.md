- Composability is a paradigm shift
- Smart contracts reduce friction for legacy systems
- For example automatically issuing a loan based on collateral versus waiting weeks 
- In traditional industries, proprietary software prevents composability
- Smart contracts are composable in the fact they can interact with each other
	- Existing programs can be adapted or build upon for new use cases
- Why is composability possible?
	- Standards like ERC20, ERC721, among others 
		- https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/tree/master/EIPS
		- Similar to the standardizing of the internal and email protocol
		- We need the ends of the pieces to match in order to connect
- Composability in DeFi
	- Financial positions (ex. loan, borrow, trade, transact) are represented as ERC20s (shares representing your position), which can be used in other protocols to enable novel use cases
	- Essentially what yield aggregators are doing
	- General shift from inefficencies of tradfi to discovering new potential opportunities that people can do with their money
	- Current issue is abstracting the underlying technology
- Benefits for developers
	- Similar to OSS, developers can bootstrap projects quickly without rebuilding
	- Increase pace of innovation
	- "Think legos and plugins"
- Non-crypto business can opt into larger open ecosystems by leveraging crypto
	- Similar to how mom-and-pop shops leveraged the API enconomy to access more data enabling them to make more informed decisions
	- Ex. liquidity for Reddit point systems and ability for *anyone* to build on top of it 
- Composable projects
	- Earning yield through no-loss lotteries
	- NFTs plugged into DeFi
		- NFT as collateral (NFTfi)
		- NFT as AMM (sudoswap, NFTx)
		- NFT as a loan (RenFT, Charged Particles)
	- Publishing
		- Mirror (publishing platform) + Zora (NFT marketplace and minting)
			- Enables conversion of posts to NFT for crowdfunding 
			- Potential royalty on future sales (although this is debatable with bypasses and race to zero)
