# Finality in PoW vs PoS blockchains
- PoS can have absolute finality meaning there is no scenario when tx can be reverted or revoked
	- This is because number of stakers is always known and if majority of stakers agree on a block it can be finalized
- PoW have probable finality meaning there is a possibility of revert/revoke 
	- This because total hashing capacity is unknown, only estimated through puzzle difficulty and speed
	- Hashing capacity could be suddenly removed by turning off a machine, so it is possible for  blocks to fail
- On Ethereum, devs need to tackle governance of the chain and the dApps governance
