# How does Cosmos tackle the scalability issue
- Types of scaling
	- Horizontal - adding similar machines to the network/allowing more node participants to observe state and participate in state replication
	- Vertical - improving components to increase computational power allowing accepting more transactions
		- Achieved through optimizing consensus mechanisms and applications running on chain
		- Cosmos tackles this by also allowing you to run one application in parallel across multiple chains through IBC coordination
