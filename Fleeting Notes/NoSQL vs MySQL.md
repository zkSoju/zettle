# NoSQL vs SQL
- NoSQL is stored as key-value pairs with value typically being a JSON object
- Lookups are done with hash values of the primary key and which server to look for a particular item is done through key spaces
- NoSQL is great for scaling both vertically and horizontally
- Vertical scaling + horizontal scaling
- Schemaless so there's no structure
	- Changing structure in SQL databases where the structure is strictly defined isn't straight forward
- NoSQL not good at searching relations
