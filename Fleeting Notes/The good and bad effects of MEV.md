# The good and bad effects of MEV
- The good (begign MEV transaction)
	- DeFi projects rely on rational actors to ensure usefulness and stability of protocols
	- Arbitrage ensures users get best correct prices
	- Lending protocols rely on speedy liquidations to ensure lenders get paid back
	- Leads to robust protocols and dApps
- The bad (malignant MEV transaction)
	- Sandwich results in poor UX for user getting sandwiched
		- Increased slippage and worse execution
	- Competition between generalized frontrunners and gas wars can lead to network congestion and high gas for everyone
	- Miners may be incentivized to remine blocks if MEV within a block exceeds block reward
		- Threatens integrity of blockchain
