# Where do DeFi yields come from
- Lenders, stakers, and LP providers receive % reward (APR)
- Many prroject built on unsustainable ponzinomics
- Identify projects where revenue sources go to token holders
- Real revenue can come from
	- Trading fees for LPs
		- Traders pay fees to LPs who provide liquidity to swap
	- Transaction fees for services
		- Token bridging
			- Wormhole
		- Fund management (performance + management fees like a hedge fund)
			- yearnFi
		- Marketplaces
			- LooksRare
	- Option premiums/insurance premiums
	- Borrower interest
		- Interest from borrowers, where most go to lenders but protocol takes a small fee to facilitate
- Unsustainable models include
	- Inflationary yields
		- Incentivized rewards for LPs created through token inflation where no external revenue is backing rewards
		- Rewards from new tokens are **not** "real" yield
	- Unknown expenses
		- Expenses can be off-chain and on-chain, so it's difficult to track cash flow 
			- Revenue without expenses is a bad indicator
