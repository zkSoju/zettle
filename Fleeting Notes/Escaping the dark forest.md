# Escaping the dark forest

- Found a similar exploit to [[Ethereum is a dark forest]] from Lien Finance that was audited by CertiK and ConsenSys
- Two options
	- Exploit issue themselves
	- Reach out to Lien and go public with issue
- Both scenarios were at risk of being frontrun
- Collaborated with SparkPool mining pool in order to get transactions included in block without being broadcasted to the mempool
- Collaborated with a bunch of others to get in connection with each other to make this rescue mission possible without repeating [[Ethereum is a dark forest]]
