# What is Defi?

- Collective term for financial products and services accessible to anyone who can use Ethereum
- No centralized authorities that can block payments or deny access
- Slow services prone to human error are now automatic and safer because they are reliant on open source code
- Example cases
	- Employee payroll
	- Loans without need for personal identification
	- Options trading
	- Earning interest
- Problems DeFi tackles
	- Some people aren't granted access to financial services
	- Lack of access to these services prevent employment and ability to be paid
	- Personal data is sacrificed 
	- Governments and centralized institutions can close markets at will
	- Money transfers can take days 
	- There's a premium for financial services because intermediaries need cut
