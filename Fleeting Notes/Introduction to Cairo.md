# Introduction to Cairo
Cairo is used to build L2 dApps with L1 security and significantly improved throughput. 
- What is Cairo? 
	- Cairo is the first universal Von Neumann STARK Architecture (proof system).
		- Designed for STARK proof efficiency with immutable memory and field elements as native type.
		- Built on components called builtins that provide efficient ways to run non-trivial computations like hashes, signatures, and range checks.
- Key features
	- Universal
	- Scalable
		- Scalability is provided by the [[Computational Integrity]] that Cairo is built upon, such that it is efficent and STARK proven.
	- Transparent Cairo as MVL - Minimum Viable Language for production STARK systems
	- **Goldilocks principle:** "just right" balance of expressiblity and STARK prover efficiency
	- **Neither too hot (simple):** 3 registers (PC, allocation pointer, frame pointer) and minimal instruction set
	- **Nor too cold:** support functions, recursion, branching, etc.
