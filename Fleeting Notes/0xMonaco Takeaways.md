# 0xMonaco Takeaways
- Premise involves purchasing shells and acceleration given a base number of coins from an gradual dutch auction meaning there are ideal times to purchase
- Involves a great deal of economic and meta-game theory to determine when to take one of the three emerging strategies which prioritizes one of the following
	- Acceleration
	- Throwing shells
	- Economics/coins
- Importance of exhausting coins at end of race to accelerate to finish line
- Play cautious when others are aggressive (throwing shells)
- Play aggressive when others are passive (not throwing shells)
- Winning car (Opensea) 
	- Initially sat back and allowed cars with other strategies to duke it out and burn coins
	- Mid game maintained speed without triggering aggressive acceleration that would cause other players to shell then shelled only when in second place
		- Save up coins for strong finish
