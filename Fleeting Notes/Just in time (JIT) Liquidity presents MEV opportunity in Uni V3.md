# Just in time (JIT) Liquidity presents MEV opportunity in Uni V3
- Uni V3 allows LP providers to specify range their liquidity is active for for capital efficiency
- Tighter tick range generates larger share of fees but increases risk of impermanence loss which is the likelihood asset pair moves out of range and generates you no fees
- Example
	- You identify $10M pending order on a 0.3% fee pool
	- You then frontrun this and provide $10M of liquidity at the tighest possible range granting you a greater share of fee revenue
	- You then remove liquidity in order to not incur additional risk
- Non-atomic in nature, capital intensive. Why?
- Chainsight says atomic
