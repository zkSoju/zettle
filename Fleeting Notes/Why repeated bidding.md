# Why repeated bidding?
- Compare with single bid settings
	- Sealed bid auction
		- Players would be incentivized to bid as close to 1 which would throw away almost all profits
	- Fixed block auction
		- Placing multiple bets is only a viable strategy if duration is random; however, if duration is known ahead of time 
	- POS blockchains
		- Sealed bid will likely be norm on POS
			- Identity of miners (they themselves?) are known in advance meaning that they can accept bids from offchain comm
			- Block duration more predictable
				- Miner forfeits spot if time limit for broadcasting is not met
				- Still unpredictable on this limit and miners wishing to collect as many lucrative tx before broadcasting but becomes more statistically predictable
