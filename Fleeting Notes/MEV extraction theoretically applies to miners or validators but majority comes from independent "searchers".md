# MEV extraction theoretically applies to miners or validators but majority comes from independent "searchers"

- Miners/validators are only party that can guarantee execution
- However, majority of MEV comes from "searchers" who run complex algorithms to detect profitable MEV opportunities then have bots submit profitable transactions
- Miners/validators get portions though since searchers pay high fees to be included
	- Gas fee a searcher is willing to pay will be up to 100% searcher MEV (in order to be profitable)
- Highly competitive opportunities like DEX arbitrage require searchers to pay 90% of revenue in fees
