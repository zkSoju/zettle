# Learn about the Cosmos ecosystem
- Zones are heterogenous blockchains that authenticate accounts, create/distribute tokens, and execute changes
- Hubs is a zone that connects zones with other zones
- If a zone is a non-Tendermint chain, an IBC adaption can be made
- If other chain is probabilistic, adaption isn't sufficient, a proxy chain called a peg-zone can be made to establish interoperability
- IgniteCLI reduces boilerplate code and scaffolds components for production ready blockchain
