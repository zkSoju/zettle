# Features of zkSTARKS
-   Privacy (zero knowledge, ZK)
-   Scalability
    -   Exponentially small verifier run time and near linear prover run time
-   Universality
    -   Applicability to general computation
    -   Cairo is the primary language for writing programs that you get efficient stark proofs
-   Transparency
    -   No toxic waste
-   Lean and battle hardened cryptography
- Instead of relaying all transactions and across the network, we can have zero trust in the prover and still be able to verify the validity of its new network state given the proof.
