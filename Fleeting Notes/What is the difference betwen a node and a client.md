# What is the difference betwen a node and a client
- After the merge, users must run both the execution and consensus clients together to gain access to Ethereum network
	- Prior execution alone was possible
- Consensus is required to  keep track of head of chain
- Node is instance of ethereum client connected to other computers
- Client is implementation of Eth that verifies data against protocol rules and keeps network software
	- Execution client listens to new tx broadcasted, executes them in EVM, and holds latests state and database of all current data
	- Consensus client implements PoS algorithm, enabling network to achieve agreement based on data from execution
