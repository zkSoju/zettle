# It is infeasible to calculate the total potential MEV in a blockchain

- MEV can be created any time a user interacts with a blockchain or smart contract
- MEV we are aware of only constitutes lower bound
- Majority of MEV is currently exploited by non-miners not miners
- However, majority of MEV can only be captured by miners because they have power to re-order, include, or exclude
- Most MEV is "simple" PGA-styled because non-miners cannot access the above capabilities
- MEV can also be possible in theft from vulnerable smart contracts
	- Dan from "Dark Forest" tried to recover funds to by exploiting a vulnerability before a thief but an arb bot frontrun him
