# It is difficult to fix MEV so how do we mitigate it
- MEV at a large scale may make "tax" on Ethereum users unbearable
- Impaired UX and stall ETH network effects
- Better application design
- Additional security incentives - additional revenue streams for miners could offset MEV
- Research into making destabilizing consensus more difficult or costly (time-bandit attacks)
	- Separating inclusion and ordering
		- Inclusion could be responsibility of miners/validators and ordering auctioned off separate
		- Could lead to multi-block time-bandit attack though
	- Finality - Strong finality guarantees requires greater collusion to re-org even a single block
		- However, participants have authority to re-org in blocks which they are proposer
	- POS - Slashing validators who re-org, however depending on MEV could be more profitable to re-org
