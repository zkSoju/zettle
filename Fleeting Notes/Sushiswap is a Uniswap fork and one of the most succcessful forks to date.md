# Sushiswap is a Uniswap fork and one of the most succcessful forks to date
- Majority of blockchain is open-sourced
- Smart contracts binary is public on the blockchain 
- Most projects post precompiled source on Github
- This makes it easy for someone to copy paste existing protocols, which are called forks
- Sushiswap employed a vampire attack which used Uniswap's fork and offered users better benefits (rewards, fee rewards) to get users to migrate
	- aka. "community oriented" features
	- Earn SUSHI tokens for depositing into LP and then receive portion of total fee for staking SUSHI
	- Users were unable to deposit any token to start earning SUSHI, they had to deposit Uniswap LP tokens
		- Users deposited into Uniswap to receive LP tokens and then transferred to SushiSwap which resulted in 55% of Uniswap's liquidity being siphoned
- On top of vampire attack, which surprisingly brought more value into the ecosystem, the launch of UNI, governance token, brought sustained growth to Uniswap
- Learnings
	- DeFi protocols could be forked if they did not meet community/industry standards
	- Healthy competition and dynamics where users can easily be redirected to competitors with better incentivies
	- Projects come under pressure to decentralize and cede control to communities
		- Governance tokens in which there is fair equity and no one (founders/devs/vc) can game the launch
