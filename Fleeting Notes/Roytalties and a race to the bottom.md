# Royalties and a race to the bottom
- With the move from marketplaces to compete with each other, a race to the bottom occurs when royalties/creator fees become optional and marketplace fees become minimal
- There are ways to enforce creator fees but many suffer some level of consequences
	- Easy to circumvent (wrapping NFT)
	- Weaken the trust model (modify ownership, metadata, authorize transfer)
	- Restrictive (no composability and security suffers) by enforcing a harberger transfer tax when owner supplies a valuation for NFT
