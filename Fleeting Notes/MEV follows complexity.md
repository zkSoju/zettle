# MEV follows complexity
- For this reason MEV is not unique to Ethereum
- MEV is proportional to complexity of application layer
- Ethereum's complexity may be a curse
- With Bitcoin Lightning Network we could remove opcodes needed to create payment channels
- With Ethereum we could not prevent behavior of applications without permissioning deployment or constraining EVM 
	- Preventing "permissionless smart contracts" 
	- Impossible without altering DX/UX
- Prevention of miners from accessing revenue stream incentivizes creation of off-protocol markets
	- If only flat rate was able to be taken miners would collude with traders offchain for priority fees
	- If tx fees were burned then miners would accept fees separately
