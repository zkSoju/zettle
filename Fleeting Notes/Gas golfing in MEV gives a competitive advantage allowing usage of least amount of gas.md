# Gas golfing in MEV gives a competitive advantage allowing usage of least amount of gas
- Terminology is also used for programming smart contracts but is also applicable to programming transactions such that a searcher is able to use the least amount of gas possible
- Known MEV golfing techniques include
	- Using addresses that start with a long string of zeros
	- Leaving a small token balance in contracts since it costs more gas to initialize a storage slot than update
