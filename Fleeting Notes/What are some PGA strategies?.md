# What are some PGA strategies?
- Three types
	- *Blindraising* and *Counterbidding* which are usually in competition with each other
	- *Cooperative*
		- Probably not perfect coordination because otherwise on-chain bidding wouldn't be needed
- Latency wars
	- Lower latency gives advantage
- Blind raising 
	- Non-adaptive strategy
