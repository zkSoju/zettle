# Return to the dark forest
- Tx are first broadcast to mempool before being included in a block
- Unconfirmed tx are feast for trading bots who are able to capitilize with efficiency
- Eth is littered with corpses of tx that have ben frontrun before being fulfilled
- Fastest frontrunner wins
	- Highest gas bidder give you an edge to be processed quickly
	- However propogation of these tx is a bottleneck that could give an advantage if tackled
		- bloXroute was first to cater to this by providing privileged access to mining pools and bypass armed bots
			- Served as a pay-to-play super sonic highway custom built for a non-militarized zone
			- Highest tx player is observed to be a frontrunner
				- In one tx, frontran a CRV -> ETH Uniswap swap with $16.29 in fees compared to victim's $4.17 
					- Victim's tx failed and victim attempted several more times without success
	- Frontrunning is vampiric
		- Feeds off weaker participants
		- Sends gas prices to unusable levels when in conflict with other bots
		- Normal users lose when issuing failing tx and paying gas costs
	- bloXroute then charged $1,250/month for "private transaction" feature to protect against frontrunning
	- **Essentially bloX had a service to optimize frontrunning by bypassing the mempool with an additional service for normal users to prevent frontrunning**
	- As long as frontrunning is profitable, it is only rational to become the aggressor
		- Cannot assume innocence
	- EIP1559 may improve situation
	- Nothing stops dark pools from allowing gas auctions on their private network
