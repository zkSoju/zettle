# Why programmable money?

- With Bitcoin you couldn't program logic into payments, which prevents the building of necessary finance services beyond currency
	- Lending, borrowing, scheduling, investing in index funds, etc.
- Send money around globe quickly or stream based on time unlocks
- Access stable currencies
	- Protect savings in time of uncertainty with government issued currencies
	- Value pegged to another asset
- Borrowing
	- P2P
	- Pool based
	- Privacy enabled, collateral is used instead (ex. NFTs)
- Access to global funds
- Flashloans
