# Inner workings of Anchor yields
- Anchor used an unsustainable model where at one point buyers could gain for borrowing
	- Borrowers paid 20% but received 27% as incentivized rewards
		- Good for borrowers, bad for token holders
			- When rewards dry up, borrowing demand plumments and revenue as well
